# Public-projects
Selected code from projects I've worked on
Some of the projects include source code pre-written by Michael Main from the textbook "Data Structures and Other Objects using C++". Some has been heavily edited by me, but much of it is not my work. The edited portions of the source code is marked to show my work.
